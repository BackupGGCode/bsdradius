# BSD Radius to-do list.

* Make "make distribution" script.
This script should compile BSD Radius itself and it's dependant modules into
bytecode or even single binary. It would be very helpful in distributing closed
source software

* We should make some more options available in config file to control BSD Radius
logging behavior. It should be possible to enable/disable logging of failed and/or
unhandled requests.

* Define t_rm_finished_call trigger also for MySQL.
