# Keep list of static user data here.
# This is the most primitive way how to authorize users. You can authorize
# them by username/password only.
# 
# Syntax:
# [<user_name>]
# description = <short description, i.e. name, last name>
# password = <user password>
#
# Example:
# [bob]
# description = Bob Lollsroyce
# password = lk23@F12Dx

[testuser]
description = test user
password = testing123

[testuser1]
description = test user number two
password = testing1234
