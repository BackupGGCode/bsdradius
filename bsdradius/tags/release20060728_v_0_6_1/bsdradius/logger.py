"""
Data Tech Labs logger module
contains functions that are needed to log messages
to screen or logfile.


Usable functions:
	printToFile(*arguments)
	error(*arguments)
	debug(*arguments)
	info(*arguments)
	
	
Global configuration variables with defaults:

  # show error messages. True - show, False - don't show
  showErrors	= True
  
  # show debug messages. True - show, False - don't show
  showDebug	= True
  
  # show informative messages. True - show, False - don't show
  showInfo	= True
  
  # enable or disable logging to screen
  logToScreen = True


To enable logging to file please initiate
logfile handle: logFile

Example: 
	import logger
	logger.logFile = file('./logfile.log', 'a')
	
	from logger import printToFile, error, debug, info
	error ('This is ', 'error message')
	debug ('This is debug mesasge')
	info ('This is ', 1, '-st info message')
	printToFile('logging something to file')
